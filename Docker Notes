-> it will be have application IMAGES to configer.

How to run and create the Docker Container?[DOCKER HUB]
->first create the image inside the docker desktop.
-> in image it can the image id and all informatio.
-> Then click on the run buttkon they show the create a container add the localhost number and add the network all the information.
-> create the container.

how to install image in my container ?
-> first install Docker Desktop in your Laptop.
-> check the docker are installed not use [docker]

##### COMMANDS FOR DOCKER ######
1) docker   -> it can be show the docker is avaliable are not.
2) docker --version   -> it can show the version of docker.
3) docker login  -> it can be liogin the DOCKER HUB account.

4) docker image ls -> in case we can have any images in my docker use this command to show the all images.
5) docker pull imagename -> it can download the new image in docker.
6) docker search imagename  -> it can show the related all the images for searching.
7) docker inspect image imagename  -> it can be show the over all information of the particular image.

## ------- how to create container using terminal  commands ------##
1) docker ps  -> it can be show the running state containers.
2) docker ps -a  -> it can show the how many containers are runnung and how many are stoping.
3) docker create imagename   -> it can be created the docker container in particular image.
4) docker create --name nameofcontainer imagename  -> it can be created by customised container like user defined containered.
5) docker run --name containername imagename -> it can be create the container and automaticaly run the container and start the container but defacult to stop this 
                                                any functional keys are not work.[ctrl + q, ctrl + c, ctrl + z]any key not work.
6) docker run -d --name continername imagename  -> it the use of the creating the container and it can start but nut run the container use this to create container.

##----remove the container ----##
1) docker rm <imageid & containerid> -> it can be remove the container.
2) docker rmi <imageid & containerid> --> it can also remove the container.
3) docker kill <imageid & containerid> -> it can be kill the container means, it can be showdown  fourcefully in container means any background are working also it can be close the all.
4) docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) -> it can be remove the multipul containers at a time. this is loop.
5) docker <imageid & containerid> prune ----> it can be remove the all the containers.
6) docker rmi -f <image_id> ----> If the image is being used by a container, you need to stop the container first. To force-remove an image.


### ----- Running containers ------###
1) docker start containername(or)CONTAINERID
2) docker stop  containername(or)CONTAINERID

###----DOCKER NETWORKING -----###
networking means one or more connection in internet
there are three networks are avaliable 
1) Brig network -> [ docker run -d --name contername -p 8081:80 imagename ]
        Brige network means it can be craeted the unique hosting address but same ip of container.
        Like:- expl i can have the 3 containers i want to run that into the google that time i want to create the bridge network 
                it can be used to access the container ip and create unique host[8081][8082].
2) Host network -> [ docker run -d containername --net host imagename ]
                  Host network means it can directly use the docker ip address and run the google not use any host number.
3) None network -> [docker run -d containername --net none imagename]
                  None network means it work on the non host address.

use this into the docker host:- 
1) check hostname
2) check the ip address use [ifconfig]
3) docker nework ls -> it can show the networks are avaliable 
4) check image and create the container use command as [ docker run -d --name containername -p 8080:80 imagename ]
5) check the ip address and copy that and past the google and host number also you can run it can open the google browser.
6) [docker network inspect brige ]


###----What are the volumes in Docker ?----####
-> it can be store container data perminatly with out volume container data must be temporieriely.
To create a Docker Volume use the command
-----------------------------------------
docker volume create testvol1
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect testvol1
---------------------------------------
Mounting a Volume using -v or --mount
---------------------------------------
docker run -it --name=srv01 --mount source=testvol1,destination=/data centos
docker run -it --name srv04 -v testvol1:/data centos
docker run -it --volumes-from srv01 --name srv02 centos /bin/bash
---------------------------------------
Mounting a Host Directory as a Data volume 
---------------------------------------
mkdir files
cd files
touch file.txt
docker run -it –-name srv05 -v "$(pwd)":/data1 centos
docker volume rm [volume_name]
------------------------------------------------

1) [docker volume ls ] -> it can show the docker volumes.
2) [ docker volume inspect volumename ] -> it can be show the where we can storing the volumes.PATH AS (var/lib/docker/volume)
3) [cd var/lib/docker/volume  ls] ->first we change the directory of the where we are storing the volume data, then use the (ls)command to find the how many volumes
                                    stored inside taht.
4) [ cd volumename ] it can be acess the particular volume. use the (ls) it can be show the what ever must be we can have all files.
6) [docker volume rm volumeid] -> it can be remove the what ever we can selected particular volume.
7) [docker volume prune] -> it can remov the all volumes with out using the any container in any volume that volumes must be remove.

###----How to create a volume for Docker Container?---###
1) [ docker volume create volumename ]-> It can be create the new volume.
2) [ docker ls] -> it can shhow the list fo volumes.
3) [ docker volume incept volumename ] -> it can be inspect the information of volume.

###---Add the volume in spefic Container ?---###
1) [docker login ] -> first login the container that add the volume.
2) [ docker run -it --name=containername --mount source=volumename,destination=/data imagename ] -> it can be add the spefic volume into container and
   [  docker run -it -name  containername -v volumenane:/data imagename ]                            add based on the image.
3) [ls] -> next check the list of the container. inside we can have the folder as data.
4) [cd data ] -> next move that folder, and create the sum any file.
5) [ touch first.txt] -> using shell script to create the file and add the data.
6) [echo " this is my first volume creation" >> first.txt] -> this command can be added the data inside created file.
7) [cat first.txt ] -> use the cat command to check they are added are not.
8) [cd volumedata storedlocation] -> go to the stored location and check that can storede are not.
9) [docker run it --volumes-from container1 --name container2 imagename /bin/bash ] -> it can be share the volume in one container to another container.

##---HOW TO CREATE THE VOLUEME IN CUSTOME FOLDER ---##
1) [ mkdir foldername ] -> using shell script to create the folder. and change the folder.
2) [mkdir file ] -> same create the another folder and change the folder.
3) [pwd] -> chewck the present working directory.
4) [touch file.txt ] -> create a file.
5) [echo "this is mydata">>file.txt] -> add the data in the created file.
6) [docker run -it -name containername -v "$(pwd)":/data1 imagename ] -> this command can be created the custom folder inside volume.
7) [ls] ->Then go and check they are created or n ot in correct directory.

##--REMOVE THE VOLUME--##
1) [docker volume rm volumename ] ->

##----DOCKER CUSTOM IMAGE CREATIONG PROCESS ----##

step1 =>  open the ubuntu and create the FOLDER inside the server.
step2 => download the code to githb. and create the docker file.
Docker File Stracture:
[[---
FROM python:3-alpine3.9 -----> ity can be install the python.
WORKDIR /app  ------> inside the container create the new folder that as app.
COPY . .   -----> it can copy the all local folder file to container inside folder.
EXPOSE 5000  ----> by default flask local host number.
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt   ----> Dependence install in server.
CMD ["flask", "run", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]  ---> running command.
----]]

step3 => change the path of that code folder.
step4 => [docker build -t imagename .] --> it can be create the image. that spefic code.
step5 => [ docker run -p 5000:5000 imageid] -> it can be create to the container and run.
