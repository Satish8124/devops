Jenkins Explanation

1) What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used in DevOps for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying code, enabling teams to deliver software faster and with fewer errors.
2) Key Features of Jenkins:
1.	Automation: Automates repetitive tasks like building, testing, and deploying.
2.	Plugins: Over 1,800 plugins to integrate with various tools (e.g., Git, Docker, Kubernetes).
3.	Pipeline as Code: Allows you to define your build and deployment pipelines using a script (e.g., Jenkinsfile).
4.	Easy Integration: Works well with tools like GitHub, Maven, Gradle, and more.
5.	Scalability: Can be distributed across multiple machines for faster builds.
3) How Jenkins Fits in DevOps:
1.	Continuous Integration:
o	Developers commit code to a shared repository.
o	Jenkins automatically builds and tests the new code, catching issues early.
2.	Continuous Delivery/Deployment:
o	After successful builds, Jenkins can deploy code to production or staging environments.
3.	Monitoring and Reporting:
o	Provides real-time feedback on build status, test results, and code quality.
4) Why Use Jenkins in DevOps?
•	Speeds up development cycles.
•	Reduces manual errors.
•	Improves collaboration between teams.
•	Ensures code quality through automated testing.


5) Jenkins Installation in Linux.
1) Update packages:
		sudo apt update

2)  Install Java:
